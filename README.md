# Dev-ops-project-collection
Number of dev-ops projects i took as a challenge from https://www.tutorialworks.com/devops-project-ideas/
##

I found this collection of projects and wanted to challenge my self incrementally on my learning journey.
Along my learning path i would like this to be a guide for others, so that i can help people learning Dev-Ops 
and add aditional challenge for me personally to write better guides. 

## Project one.

# Main goal is to build a server that will be hosting a website in private enviroment.
##
Restrictions on the project is that it needs to be done completly programaticaly.
So infrastrucuture, initial website deployment, premissions and the rest will need to be achieved in automated way.
With the ability to repeat the same process with a single or collection of scripts.
